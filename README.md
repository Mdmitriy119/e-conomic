The task is to implement a simple iOS application that solves the following two user stories:

As a freelance I want to be able to:
 1. Take photos of my expenses (receipts or invoices).
 2. Add information about the receipt (date, total, currency, etc) and store it locally
Access the history of the photos taken (should be available offline) with the data I
inputted
 3. The app should work even if you are offline and should maintain its state after closing
 4. The solution must be thread safe and should be robust enough to handle large sets
of data.
